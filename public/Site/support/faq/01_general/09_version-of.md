A few possibilities:

* Run ident on a particular program. This will give you the RCS $Id $ information for the pieces of software that make up that program.
* For checking the version of a server, see the question
[How do I find a server's version](https://www.opendap.org/support/faq/general/server-version)?
* In Matlab or IDL run loaddods with the '-V' option.
