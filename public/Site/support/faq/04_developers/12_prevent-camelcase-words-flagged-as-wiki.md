# How do I prevent CamelCase words I use from being flagged as wiki pages ?

When entering a message string when checking code into Subversion, entering text on a wiki page or anywhere else where WikiFormatting is allowed UpperCamelCase words are automatically flagged as wiki pages. Frequently, this is not the intent. This feature be turned off by preceeding UpperCamelCase words with a "!!".
